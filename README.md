# derml
Derml  (Deji's Really Minimal Language) is a simple configuration file format

Lines that begin with the hash (#) are comments. Comments go on to the end of the line
```
    # This is a comment
```
Comments may also be indented, so the (#) has to be the first non-whitespace character on the line to make the line a comment
One final thing about commets is that the sit on a line on their own.
